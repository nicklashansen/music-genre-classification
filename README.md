# Audio Features for Music Genre Classification
Exam project on Music Genre Classification for course 02452 Audio Information Processing Systems at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

#### Abstract
Music genre classification is an inherently difficult task for machines as categorization is subjective and based on human perception. Typically, hand-engineered audio features are used in models that aim to automate genre annotation, but it is unclear which features best describe a genre and to which extent. In this study, we provide a holistic view on common audio features and apply a backward feature selection using a $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier and features extracted from a slightly imbalanced 7-genre subset (6573 audio files) of the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. We then train a 20-layer DenseNet on the best-performing feature subset -- 32 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents (MFCCs) -- and achieve a $F_{1}$-score of 0.60, which is comparable to other studies but below human-level performance measured under similar conditions. It is observed that classification performance is highly genre-dependent, which suggests that certain genres may have similar profiles in the frequency domain.
